# Set up Authenticated Origin Pulls with AWS

This guide will walk you through how to set up [per-hostname](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/) authenticated origin pulls to securely connect to an AWS Application Load Balancer using mutual TLS verify.

## Before you begin

* You should already have your AWS account and [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?icmpid=docs_homepage_featuredsvcs) configured.
* Note that this tutorial uses command-line interface (CLI) to generate a custom certificate, and [API calls](/fundamentals/api/get-started/) to configure Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls.
* For the most up-to-date documentation on how to set up AWS, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).
